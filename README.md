## What is Markdown? 

Well, **Markdown** is a language that allows you to write pages on GitHub to show off your project!
There are many different commands to create various effects. For example:\
-`**` makes the text bold. `**text**` **text**\
-`*` italicizes the text. `*text*` *text*\
-`~~` is a strikethrough. `~~text~~` ~~text~~

Additionally there are different levels of headers:
1. `#` is the largest header. `# text#`
1. `##` is the middle-sized header. `## text##`
1. `###` is the smallest header. `### text##`
