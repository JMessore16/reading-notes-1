## Growth Mindset
### What is it?
**Growth Mindset** is the belief that you can develop one's abilities through perseverance rather than natural ability alone.
Some key differences between the fixed and the growth mindset are:
1. *Challenges*: A person with a growth mindset embraces challenges
1. *Obstacles*: A person with a growth mindset persists through them.
1. *Effort*: A person with a growth mindset believes in hard work.
1. *Criticism*: A person with a growth mindset learns from criticism.
1. *Success of Others*: A person with a growth mindset is is inspired by the success of others.

**Three Reminders**
-Remeber to take breaks.
-Remember to work hard. 
-Take it one day at a time. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/david-nunes/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/david-nunes/reading-notes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
